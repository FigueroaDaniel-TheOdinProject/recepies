  <h3>Texas Chicken Spaghetti</h3>
  <p>This recipe for Texas chicken spaghetti was given to me years ago by a favorite sister-in-law, a wonderful cook. My whole family has the recipe and enjoys it too. It is easy to freeze or it can be made the day before and kept in the fridge. You can use two cans of cream of mushroom soup instead of one mushroom and one chicken.</p>

  <h4>Ingredients</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>1 package (16 ounces) uncooked spaghetti</li>
    <li>1/4 cup butter, cubed</li>
    <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
    <li>1 large green pepper, chopped</li>
    <li>1 can (14 ounces) stewed tomatoes</li>
    <li>1 can (10-1/2 ounces) condensed cream of mushroom soup, undiluted</li>
    <li>1 can (10-1/2 ounces) condensed cream of chicken soup, undiluted</li>
    <li>1 can (10 ounces) diced tomatoes and green chiles</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons sugar, optional</li>
    <li>1 package (16 ounces) Velveeta, cubed</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Steps</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350Â°. Cook spaghetti according to package directions.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, in a Dutch oven, melt butter over medium heat; add onion and pepper. Cook and stir until tender, 5-7 minutes. Drain stewed tomatoes, reserving the liquid, and chop tomatoes. Stir in soups, tomatoes and sugar if desired.</li>
    <li>Drain spaghetti; add to sauce mixture with Velveeta and chicken and if desired, reserved liquid. Transfer to a greased 13x9x2-in. baking dish. Cover and bake 20 minutes. Uncover and bake until bubbly, 5-10 minutes longer. If desired, sprinkle with parsley.</li>
  </ol>
